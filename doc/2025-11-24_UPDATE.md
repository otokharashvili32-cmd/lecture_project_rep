#### 8. **Documentation Created**
   - `FEATURES.md` - For storing all possible features (for reference)
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture and project structure
   - `README.md` - Getting started guide
   - This update document

### Current State

- ✅ Frontend React app ready to run on port 5173
- ✅ Complete authentication UI (login/signup forms)
- ✅ Main page with navigation system
- ✅ All content sections implemented (shows, discography, merch, about)
- ✅ Dark, cryptic, moody design theme
- ✅ Tall, condensed typography throughout
- ✅ Album cover image integrated
- ✅ Merchandise with prices displayed

### Technical Details

**Backend:**
- Express.js server
- CORS enabled
- Basic API endpoints
- Hardcoded data (no database yet)

**Frontend:**
- React with Vite
- State management for navigation and forms
- Responsive design
- Dark theme with glassmorphism
- Google Fonts (Oswald) for tall typography

**Styling:**

### Next Steps

- Continue adding features as needed
- Potentially add backend API endpoints for data management
- Consider adding more interactive features
- Database integration when needed (currently using hardcoded data)

### Notes

- All code is kept simple and beginner-friendly
- No database is used - data is hardcoded in backend initially
- Project follows slow, steady increment approach
- Design evolved from minimalistic to vibrant to dark/cryptic
- Typography uses tall, condensed fonts throughout
- All features are functional and styled consistently
